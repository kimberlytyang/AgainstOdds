## Description
 > Everyone takes risks and spends their money on items of questionable worth to themselves at some point. You stare at that item in that pristine, illuminated store shelf or even at that picture of it in your all too perfect online shopping cart. You envision it in your possession and all the incredible things you'll use it for, but once you obtain that one thing you've wanted for so long, it never seems as amazing as it once did, does it? Rather than endlessly regretting all the foolish purchase decisions of your past self, why not risk it all in a game of odds? With AgainstOdds, everyone has the opportunity to make it big! It all depends on how much you're willing to put in.
